#Mapping Perlin Noise Field to Pixel Brightness.

The sketch demonstrates how to map values from both X and Y coordinates of a Perlin noise field to pixel brightness on a 2D canvas.

`detail` controls the number of 'octaves' or layers of noise that are summed together to generate the Perlin noise field. 
`falloff` controls the amount of amplitude reduction for each successive layer of noise that is added.
