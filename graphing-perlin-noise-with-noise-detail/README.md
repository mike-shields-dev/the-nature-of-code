#Graphing Perlin Noise

The sketch demonstrates how to graph regions of the Perlin noise field by sampling values from different regions along the Perlin noise x-axis and plotting them along the x-axis of a 2D canvas.  

The noise detail function allows the quality of the Perlin noise field to be changed.
